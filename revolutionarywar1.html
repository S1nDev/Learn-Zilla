                The revolutionary war was a very eventful and important part of American history. It teaches us the importance of fighting for what is right and how not to give up. As it goes, the colonies were not doing well in the begining of the war. It was tough for the colonies to have to fight their powerhouse at the time: Great Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Great conflicts such as the Battle of Yorktown ensued, with George Washington leading the colonies in battle and overcoming the British army. Back-and-forth combat would continue between the colonies and Britain until both forces were exhausted of resources. Thus, an especially crucial win for the colonies came in the Battle of Saratoga. This battle marked the turning point in the war and would persuade other countries such as France and Spain to help the colonies in their struggle.
