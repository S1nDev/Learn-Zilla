            <h3>Excerpt from <u>Romeo and Juliet</u></h3>
            <h4>SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.</h4>
            <p>
                Enter <b>ROMEO</b><br /><br />
                <i>
                    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.<br />
                    <b>JULIET</b> appears above at a window<br />
                    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?<br />
                    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br />
                    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br />
                    Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br />
                    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:<br />
                    Be not her maid, since she is envious;<br />
                    Her vestal livery is but sick and green<br />
                    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br />
                    It is my lady, O, it is my love!<br />
                    O, that she knew she were!<br />
                    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?<br />
                    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br />
                    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:<br />
                    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br />
                    Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br />
                    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br />
                    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br />
                    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br />
                    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br />
                    Would through the airy region stream so bright<br />
                    That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br />
                    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br />
                    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br />
                    That I might touch that cheek!<br /><br />
                </i>
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                Ay me!<br /><br />
                <b>ROMEO</b><br />
                She speaks:<br />
                O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<br />
                As glorious to this night, being o'er my head<br />
                As is a winged messenger of heaven<br />
                Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br />
                Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br />
                When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br />
                And sails upon the bosom of the air.<br /><br />
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br />
                Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br />
                Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br />
                And I'll no longer be a Capulet.<br /><br />
                <b>ROMEO</b><br />
                [<i>Aside</i>] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?<br /><br />
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br />
                Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br />
                What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br />
                Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br />
                Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br />
                What's in a name? that which we call a rose<br />
                By any other name would smell as sweet;<br />
                So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,<br />
                Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br />
                Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br />
                And for that name which is no part of thee<br />
                Take all myself.<br /><br />
                <b>ROMEO</b><br />
                I take thee at thy word:<br />
                Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;<br />
                Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<br /><br />
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night<br />
                So stumblest on my counsel?<br /><br />
                <b>ROMEO</b><br />
                By a name<br />
                I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br />
                My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br />
                Because it is an enemy to thee;<br />
                Had I it written, I would tear the word.<br /><br />
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words<br />
                Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:<br />
                Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?<br /><br />
                <b>ROMEO</b><br />
                Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.<br /><br />
                <b>JULIET</b><br />
                How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br />
                The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br />
                And the place death, considering who thou art,<br />
                If any of my kinsmen find thee here.<br />
